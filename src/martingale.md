# Martingale System

This strategy was used in Kakegurui Twin in Episode 2, by Miboumi Aoi from the Student Council, who decided to challenge Saotome Mary's new gambling den in which he started with a 1 million yen bet and lost, then he bet 2 million yen on the second round and lost again, it appeared as if Mary is winning by 3 million yen but Mary mentions that "there is an over 90% chance of winning once in three rolls." and Aoi on his third and last round bet 4 million and won, allowing him to recover all his losses and still win a profit of a million yen.

In regards to the strategy Mary mentions that "This method isn't usually used due to the risk of a massive loss. But it's the best approach if he's trying to ruin us!"
